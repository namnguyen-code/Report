    "* Visualizing data is crucial to quickly understanding trends and relationships in your dataset\n",
    "* Matplotlib is one of the most popular libraries for plotting with Python\n",
    "* Matplotlib is known as the \"Grandfather\" of plotting and visualization libraries for Python\n",
    "* Many other visualization libraries are built directly off of Matplotlib (e.g seaborn and pandas built-in visualization)\n",
    "* Matplotlib is heavily inspired by the plotting functions of the MatLab programming language\n",
    "* It allows for the  creation of almost any plot type and heavy customization\n",
    "* This ability to heavily customize a plot comes at a trade-off for beginners, since it can be confusing to learn the Matplotlib syntax at first\n",
    "* This is mainly due to the fact that there are actually two separate approaches to creating plots, functional based methods and OOP based methods call"
